# macoser
A easy script to help setup a MacOS system.
Obviously personal as I will download systems you might not even use.
Realized however that my friends might be inspired to write a similar script for their future mac.

Also the commands that require sudo provledge is not completely certain. I will need to test this script in a VM first and determine how I go about fixing this.

I want it to be a one command download everything deal.
Still a work in progress.
